II. User Experience Flow
2.1 Initial Contact
NiaXP begins serving attendees and guests from the very first interaction, whether via text or voice.

         * Users are welcomed with a friendly introduction, explaining NiaXP’s role as an on-site (or online) assistant.
         * NiaXP prompts the user to choose between continuing in text or voice.
         * If text is preferred, the user provides a phone number for ongoing conversation; a unique session ID is created to maintain context.
         * If voice is preferred (or the user declines providing a phone number), NiaXP continues via voice, still maintaining a session ID.
         * Returning Users:

            * Session cookies or stored session IDs allow NiaXP to greet returning users with familiarity.
            * Past interactions and preferences are recalled to personalize the conversation.
