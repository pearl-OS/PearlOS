### OVERVIEW

drvn has earned a reputation for high-touch service and operational excellence. With **Smart Manifest – Powered by ViVi**, you now have the opportunity to lead the industry in intelligent transportation logistics—redefining how data is captured, processed, and transformed into actionable experiences, while laying the conversational and voice-enabled foundation for ViVi's future as an intelligent concierge across the drvn ecosystem.

**NiaXP** will design, build, and deploy an AI-powered manifest tool embedded within MTC’s FUSE and VIP Portal. The **Smart Manifest module** interprets, validates, and enriches raw passenger data in real time, enabling automated service proposal generation and reducing operational friction across teams.

This solution is built to scale, learn from client-specific preferences, and reduce the burden of manual coordination.
