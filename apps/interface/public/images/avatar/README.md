# Avatar GIFs

Place your avatar GIF files in this directory:

- `avatar-idle.gif` - The idle animation (shown when the assistant is not speaking)
- `avatar-talking.gif` - The talking animation (shown when the assistant is speaking)

The component will automatically switch between these GIFs based on the assistant's speaking state.

## File Requirements

- Format: GIF
- Recommended size: 250x250 pixels (or maintain aspect ratio)
- The component will scale the GIFs to fit the 250x250px container
