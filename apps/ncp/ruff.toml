# Ruff configuration for the apps/ncp project
# See https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/ for all options

# Assume Python 3.10 based on your previous logs.
# Adjust if your project's minimum Python version is different.
target-version = "py310"

# Set the line length. 88 is a common default (used by Black).
line-length = 88

# Enable a broad set of rules by default.
# E, W: pycodestyle errors and warnings
# F: Pyflakes (e.g., unused imports, undefined names)
# I: isort (import sorting)
# UP: pyupgrade (helps modernize Python code)
# B: flake8-bugbear (finds potential bugs and design problems)
# A: flake8-builtins (checks for shadowing builtins)
# C4: flake8-comprehensions (helps write more idiomatic comprehensions)
# SIM: flake8-simplify (helps simplify code)
# RUF: Ruff-specific rules
# TYP: flake8-typing-imports and other typing related rules
# C90: McCabe cyclomatic complexity

# You can ignore specific rules globally if needed.
# For example, if you have a legitimate reason for a long line:
# ignore = ["E501"]

# Configure the linter.
[lint]
  select = ["E", "W", "F", "I", "UP", "B", "A", "C4", "SIM", "RUF", "TYP", "C90"]
  # You can add specific configurations for linters here.
  # For example, for isort:
  [lint.isort]
    # If you have local modules that should be treated as first-party
    # known-first-party = ["my_app_module"]
  
  # Configure flake8-mccabe (complexity checks)
  [lint.mccabe]
    # Default is 10, adjust as needed for your project.
    max-complexity = 10

# Configure the formatter (Ruff's built-in auto-formatter).
[format]
  # Use double quotes for strings.
  quote-style = "double"
  # Use spaces for indentation.
  indent-style = "space"
  # Whether to skip adding a trailing comma if a statement fits on one line.
  # skip-magic-trailing-comma = false # Default
  # The line ending style.
  # line-ending = "auto" # Default
