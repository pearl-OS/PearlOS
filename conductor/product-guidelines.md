# Product Guidelines

## Communication Tone: Adaptive & Context-Aware
The system's personality is fundamentally adaptive. It monitors user interaction patterns and linguistic complexity to modulate its own tone.
*   **For Gen Z Users:** Incorporates a more casual, energetic, and expressive style, potentially using modern idioms and emojis where appropriate to feel like a "creative partner."
*   **For Non-Technical Users (e.g., Grandparents):** Shifts to a patient, nurturing, and jargon-free tone, focusing on reassurance and simple instructions.
*   **Fallback:** In all cases, the tone remains respectful and helpful, avoiding robotic or overly formal phrasing.

## Design Principles
*   **High Accessibility (Grandma-Proof):** All UI elements must have high contrast, large touch targets, and clear legible typography. Never sacrifice readability for aesthetics.
*   **Vibrant Expression (Gen Z Appeal):** The interface should feel alive. Use bold colors, smooth transitions, and micro-animations to create an engaging, modern experience.
*   **Contextual Minimalism:** Aggressively reduce cognitive load. Hide non-essential controls and only present the user with the tools they need for their current intent.
*   **Cohesive Generation:** Generated micro-apps should inherit the system's core design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) to ensure a unified feel throughout the OS.

## Error Handling & Recovery
*   **Playful Accountability:** Use light, self-deprecating humor when the system fails to understand or execute a command. This humanizes the AI and reduces user frustration.
*   **Multimodal Assistance:** When voice intent is ambiguous, provide clear, simple visual choices on the screen to guide the user back on track.
*   **Reliable Fallbacks:** Ensure there is always a "safe" path. If complex generation fails, provide a pre-built basic version or clear instructions on how to try again with simpler terms.

## Privacy & Safety
*   **Transparent Action:** Always inform the user before generating an app or accessing personal data.
*   **Age-Appropriate Guardrails:** Ensure generated content and interactions remain safe and appropriate for the detected user demographic.
