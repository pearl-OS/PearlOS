# Initial Concept
We're targeting gen z college students currently, but we're looking at creating an AI assitted opeating system that can generate apps based on the users needs. e.g. your grandma should be able to use it.

# Product Vision
Nia Universal is a playful and creative AI-assisted operating system designed to bridge the gap between technical power and human simplicity. It aims to empower everyone—from Gen Z students to non-technical users like grandparents—by providing a voice-first, multimodal interface that replaces traditional OS complexity with intuitive, generative capabilities.

# Core Goals
*   **Zero-Learning Curve:** Provide a voice-first interface that eliminates the friction of navigating menus and complex file systems.
*   **Generative Agility:** Enable the instant creation of personalized "micro-apps" (HTML/CSS/JS) that solve specific, immediate user needs.
*   **Seamless Integration:** Act as a unified, collaborative hub for existing productivity tools like Gmail, Calendar, and Notes.

# Key Features
*   **Multimodal Interaction:** Seamlessly blend natural language voice commands with touch interactions for a natural user experience.
*   **Proactive App Generation:** An intelligent assistant that doesn't just find apps, but *builds* them on demand based on user intent.
*   **Reactive Avatars:** High-fidelity Rive avatars that provide real-time visual and emotional feedback to make the assistant feel present and supportive.
*   **Unified Data Access:** A stable core that aggregates and manages data from various providers through a single, unified layer.
