## PROMPT ENGINEERING

Recommnended explorations - requires tracking known areas (Forum, Studio, Notepad, etc.)

## METRICS FOR TOKEN REDEMPTIONS

Track number of shares of applets/notes (unique inbound users).  Determine whether to store share counts in the applet, sharing org, or other data struct - we may already have it in the sharing org.

## WISH LIST

Create a duplicate/copy button for applets, to pull a shared one into personal use.
