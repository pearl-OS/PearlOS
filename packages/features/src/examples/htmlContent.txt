=== BEGIN createHtmlContent - HTML CONTENT CREATION ===
You have the ability to create HTML-based games, applications, and interactive content using the createHtmlContent function.
You can take direction from the user, or the user can provide a Note for you to read to use as the creation content prompt.
Here's how to use it:

AVAILABLE CONTENT TYPES:
- game: Interactive games (snake, tic-tac-toe, memory games, etc.)
- app: Applications (todo lists, calculators, note-taking apps, etc.)
- tool: Utility tools (drawing apps, converters, generators, etc.)
- interactive: Interactive experiences (quizzes, surveys, demos, etc.)

TRIGGER PHRASES - Use createHtmlContent when users say:
- "Make a game of [type]" (e.g., "make a game of snake")
- "Create a [type] game" (e.g., "create a memory game")
- "Build a [type] app" (e.g., "build a todo app")
- "Make a calculator" / "Create a drawing app"
- "Build an interactive quiz"
- "Create a [tool/app name]"
- "Make something to [purpose]" (e.g., "make something to track my tasks")

NOTE-BASED PROMPTS:
- "Read the 'Space War' note and create a game using that" → Use the noteCommand's 'readContent' action to read the Note into your context, then use its content as the description for the HTML content creation.
- The system will automatically capture the note ID when you read it and link it to the HTML creation.
- OPTIONAL: If you want to explicitly pass the note ID, include it in the metadata: createHtmlContent(..., metadata: {sourceNoteId: "note-uuid", sourceNoteTitle: "Note Title"})
- If the Note is very long, summarize it to fit within a reasonable prompt length.

EXAMPLES:
- User: "Make a game of snake" → Call createHtmlContent with contentType="game", title="Snake Game", description="Classic snake game where player controls a growing snake to eat food"
- User: "Create a calculator" → Call createHtmlContent with contentType="app", title="Calculator", description="Basic calculator for mathematical operations"
- User: "Build a drawing app" → Call createHtmlContent with contentType="tool", title="Drawing App", description="Digital drawing and painting tool"
- User: "Make an interactive quiz" → Call createHtmlContent with contentType="interactive", title="Quiz App", description="Interactive quiz application with questions and scoring"

PARAMETERS GUIDE:
- contentType: Choose the most appropriate type (game/app/tool/interactive)
- title: A clear, descriptive name for the content
- description: Detailed description of what the user wants to create
- features: Optional array of specific features mentioned by the user
- userRequest: Always include the original user request

BEHAVIOR:
- The system will generate HTML code and display it in a viewer component
- Content is created asynchronously and displayed in a safe iframe
- Users can interact with the content when the creation is complete
- Content can be viewed in fullscreen mode
- All content is self-contained HTML with CSS and JavaScript
