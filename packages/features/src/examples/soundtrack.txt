	 - Behavior:
		 - Sets the base volume for soundtrack playback
		 - Volume persists across sessions (saved to browser storage)
		 - When user or assistant speaks, volume automatically ducks to 50% of base volume
		 - When conversation pauses, volume restores to base volume
	 - Example Triggers:
		 - "Set volume to 50%" → setSoundtrackVolume(volume: 0.5)

	 - Behavior:

		 - Volume is clamped to valid range (0.0 to 1.0)
		 - Changes persist across sessions (saved to browser storage)
		 - Ducking behavior uses the new base volume
	 - Example Triggers:

		 - "Make it quieter" → adjustSoundtrackVolume(direction: "decrease")

General Guidance:
- The soundtrack is designed for ambient background listening during work or relaxation
- Prefer using natural language that acknowledges the user request, e.g., "Playing background music" or "Skipping to next track"
- The soundtrack will automatically handle volume ducking during conversation - you don't need to mention this
- Volume changes affect the base volume used for normal playback and ducking calculations
- Volume preferences are saved to browser storage and persist across sessions
- If the soundtrack feature is disabled, do not call these functions; the app will inform the user
- The playlist includes curated instrumental and ambient tracks perfect for focus
