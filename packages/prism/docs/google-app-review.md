## Terms of Service

Welcome to Nia. By accessing or using our alpha-stage software, you agree to these Terms & Conditions. Please read them carefully.

Nia is currently in alpha development, which means you’re using an early, experimental version of the software. You may encounter bugs, incomplete features, or unexpected behavior. We appreciate your participation and patience as we continue to improve.

You must be at least 18 years old to use Nia and must be authorized to connect any third-party accounts such as Google Workspace. You agree not to misuse the system, attempt unauthorized access, or overload our servers. We ask that you do not upload highly sensitive data at this stage, such as protected health or financial information.

All intellectual property associated with Nia including the design, code, and underlying technology—remains the property of the company. You agree not to copy, modify, distribute, or reverse engineer any part of the platform.

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access at any time, especially in cases of misuse or security concerns. Because this is alpha software, Nia is provided “as is,” and we are not liable for any damages, data loss, or service interruptions.

We may update these Terms as the product evolves. If changes are made, we’ll notify you. Your continued use after those updates means you accept the new terms.

These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware. If you have questions, please contact us at [nia@niaxp.com](mailto:nia@niaxp.com).

## Privacy Policy

At Nia, your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information while you're participating in our alpha-stage testing program.

During this stage, we collect limited information, including any Google Workspace data you authorize us to access—such as your emails, calendar events, and files from Gmail, Calendar, and Drive. We also collect general usage data, like how you interact with the product, and any optional feedback or notes you choose to share.

We use this data to deliver contextual and personalized experiences, to improve Nia’s performance, and to communicate with you during testing. We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties. Your data is encrypted both in transit and at rest, and only essential, anonymized logs are visible to select team members for debugging and support purposes.

You remain in control of your data at all times. You can revoke Nia’s access to your Google account via your Google settings. If you'd like your data deleted, simply email us at [Insert Email].

Nia integrates with Google and other third-party platforms strictly for functionality you've authorized. We comply fully with Google’s Limited Use Policy and maintain high privacy standards throughout.

If you have any questions or concerns about this policy, please contact us at [Insert Email] or by mail at [nia@niaxp.com](mailto:nia@niaxp.com).

## App Description

This application, Nia, helps users organize and recall important information across meetings, emails, and files by unifying fragmented context into a single, intelligent interface.

For example: This application, Nia, helps users stay on top of conversations, tasks, and decisions by surfacing exactly what they need, when they need it, without switching tools.

## Why Access to Your Google Account is Requested

Nia uses the Gmail, Calendar, and Drive APIs to organize and present user information in a personalized, context-rich interface. This allows users to search and synthesize information across messages, meetings, and files without leaving Nia’s interface. To achieve this, Nia integrates with your Google account, specifically accessing:

- **Google Calendar API:**  
    Enables Nia to analyze meetings and display upcoming events with related notes, files, and follow-ups in one place.

- **Gmail API:**  
    Allows Nia to surface relevant email threads tied to meetings, tasks, or clients, and to help you recall what’s been said or shared.

- **Google Drive API:**  
    Lets Nia index and suggest documents that are contextually related to your conversations, calendar events, or to-dos.

## How Your Data is Used

The data accessed from your Google account is used solely to provide personalized context and memory across your workspace. This includes showing related files before a meeting, summarizing conversations, or helping you recall next steps from emails or events.

Data is not shared with third parties and is not used for advertising or profiling. All use is strictly governed by our Privacy Policy and is limited to the scope of the services you explicitly authorize.

For example:

- **Calendar data** is used to display upcoming meetings and generate contextual summaries.
- **Gmail data** is used to recall relevant past conversations tied to meetings or topics.
- **Drive data** is used to surface useful files in the context of tasks or events.
